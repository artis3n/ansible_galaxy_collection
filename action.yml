      DEPRECATED.

      A collection must have a galaxy.yml file that contains the necessary information to build a
      collection artifact.

      Defaults to "galaxy.yml" in the `collection_dir`, which is by default the project root.

      This parameter is deprecated as Ansible Galaxy requires the file to be named `galaxy.yml` and to exist in the root of your Collection. Use `collection_dir` to specify a non-root directory for your Collection.
    required: false
    default: 'galaxy.yml'
